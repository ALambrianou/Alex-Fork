# External data directory

Use this directory to store data that you fetch from outside the repository.

See the `../fetch_data.py` script for an example.

This directory, by default, has a `.gitignore` file that tells Git not to  store any files in this directory.

You can override this behavior with `git add -f`.  See the Git
documentation for details.
