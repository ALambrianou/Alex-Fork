# Airbnb Datascience Project


## Introduction


### Data sourcing
The Dataset for this project contains listing data for Air BnB for London, September 2022. The dataset used is a precleaned dataset from Kaggle, that was sourced from http://insideairbnb.com.

### Data cleaning
The dataset we are using comes precleaned/processed, as such cleaning is a relatively straight forward task with minor alterations made mostly for clarity.  
(For specifics please see the cleaning.py file within the projtools directory)

Overview  
-Setting the 'id' column to the pandas index  
-Renaming columns for clarity  
-Removing special characters  
-Dropping unecessary columns

### Data Description
The data set contains 48 Columns and 69351 rows/entries. The columns contain data pertaining to the property, the host, the location and reviews.  
To explore the dataset run the following cells.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from projtools import data_tools, plotting_tools  
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)

```

```{python}
#Full pandas dataframe
data = data_tools.data_setup()
data.head()
```

### Descriptive Stats

```{python}
numerical_data = data_tools.group_data(data,'numerical')
numerical_data.describe()
```

## Standout Stats

Hosting Listings - Large difference between Max and the upper quartile, suggesting there is a small number with a high concentration.  
Calculated Host Listings count - Large difference between the max number or listings and max number of properties.  
Maximum nights - London has 90 day limit on stays, but this data seems to show that the second quartile for max nights is exactly 1 year.  
Maximum nights average bookings - The first quartile seems to be 90 days but the second and third seem to be just over 3 years.  
Reviews - The number of reviews count 69344 does not match up with the review scores counts, there is roughly 25% more rows with reviews than there are rows with actual review scores




### Host Listings


According to a wired article {cite}`temperton_2020` , citing data compiled by London city hall, in May 2019 1% of Airbnb hosts were behind 15% of active listings on Airbnb.

This Dataset is from September 2022 so we can test whether over the 3 years there has been any change.

```{python}
host_listings_count = numerical_data['host_listings_count']
print(host_listings_count.describe())

```

We can see here that the first quartile is 1, the second quartile is 2 and the third quartile is 5. There is marked jump between that and the max of 2157.

```{python}
df = pd.read_csv("C:/Users/oscar/OneDrive/Desktop/archive/clean_df.csv")
```

```{python}
