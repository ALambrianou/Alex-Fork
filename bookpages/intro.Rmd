# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

This project aims to explore the short term rental market in London, specifically Airbnb. 
In our analysis, we used a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of around 70,000 Airbnb listings in London. The dataset is a precleaned dataset that was originally sourced from http://insideairbnb.com. 
This dataset has a detailed view of each listing, including but not limited to host details, amenities, booking information, and the duration of stay.
We use journalistic articles and statistics, for the basis of Airbnb usage and pricing in London.
