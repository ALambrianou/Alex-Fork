# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

This project aims to explore the short term rental market in London, specifically Airbnb. 
In our analysis, we used a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of around 70,000 Airbnb listings in London. The dataset is a precleaned datasetm that was originally sourced from http://insideairbnb.com. 
This dataset has a detailed view of each listing, including host details, a wide range of amenities, booking information, and the duration of stay.
We use journalistic articles for a basis of Airbnb usage in London and for price analysis.
